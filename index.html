<a href='/goals.html'>jfdi goals club</a> - The jfdi goals club is like a
support group for people who daydream and sometimes make lists, but don't carry
out their plans nearly regularly enough.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href='/games.html'>jfdi games club</a> - The jfdi games club is like a book
club, except for video games.  More specifically, it's a way to get some reason
to play some of the games you've acquired in Steam but never managed to play.
We'll pick a game, have two weeks to play it, and then we'll talk about the
game on IRC.
