<p>
The jfdi games club is like a book club, except for video games.  More
specifically, it's a way to get some reason to play some of the games you've
acquired in Steam but never managed to play.  We'll pick a game, have two weeks
to play it, and then we'll talk about the game on IRC.

If you want to join up, [subscribe to the mailing
list](https://jfdi.topicbox.com/groups/games).

  What's the Steam ID?

  <ul>
    <li>we'll use it to try to pick games that most members have but haven't
        played</li>
    <li>you can always add your Steam ID later, butâ€¦</li>
    <li><a style='color:#0ff' href='https://store.steampowered.com/login/'>log in to Steam</a></li>
    <li>click your username (between "community" and "about)</li>
    <li>your user id is the thing between "id" and "home" in the URI (it might
        be a username or it might be a huge number)</li>
  </ul>
